# Description 
This is a project I created for my Artificial Intelligence course at Humber College.

# Features
## General
- Tile-based procedural dungeon system based upon the techniques pioneered by Joris Dormans
  - Cyclic level generation with primary and secondary cycles
  - Uses random walk and A* algorithms on a graph to generate full cycles
  - Uses the graph to place randomly chosen prefab rooms in the same configuration

## AI
- Steering algorithms
  - Seek
  - Flee
  - Arrive
  - Avoid
  - Pursue
  - Evade
  - Look at Target
  - Look Where Moving

- Pathfinding
  - Dijkstra and A* algorithms
 
- AI behaviours using a Finite State Machine
  - Uses Unity's Scriptable Objects for Actions, Decisions, States and Transitions
